# python-terminal

<p>Python-Terminal, an alternative to the classic terminal, but because bash isn't available by default in windows, 
meaning you are not able to write scripts to execute cmd commands, python-terminal gives you the opportunity to create multiple files/folders, change directories
and hash folder/file names.</p>
